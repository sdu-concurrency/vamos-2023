### 17th International Working Conference on Variability Modelling of Software-Intensive Systems

VaMoS aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share ideas, results and experiences about their quest for mastering variability. Most of today's software is made variable to allow for more adaptability and economies of scale, while many development practices (e.g., DevOps, A/B testing, parameter tuning, continuous integration) support this goal of engineering software variants. VaMoS is the ideal venue to explore the underlying problems (automation, traceability, combinatorial explosion) and their solutions.
As such, in addition to its usual call for technical research papers, VaMoS strongly supports the participation of aspiring young researchers as well as practitioners from industry.
