title: CyberSecurity Days 2020
---

CyberSecurity Days 2020 is the second edition of a two-day cybersecurity seminar to promote IT security in Denmark. The event is
funded by the [Centre for Cybersecurity](https://fe-ddis.dk/cfcs/Pages/cfcs.aspx) of the [Ministry of Defence](https://fmn.dk/eng/Pages/frontpage.aspx) and held as a collaboration among danish educational and research  institutions (AAU, AU, CBS, DTU, ITU, KEA, and SDU).

The CyberSecurity Days are designed with the primary goal to provide participants with cutting-edge, comprehensive knowledge on the main issues and best practices related to cybersecurity; useful to both private citizens and organisations. Through active lectures and practical exercises, the participants will gain and develop the necessary knowledge and skills to understand the concepts and the technologies for achieving security in IT systems---examples include threat analysis, avoidance, and mitigation (both at the technical and business level), as well as data security management (authenticity, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, etc.).

CyberSecurity Days also serve as a place where industry, public companies, students, and institutions can meet, discuss about cybersecurity and informally explore future collaborations. It is a special occasion to talk to experts on cybersecurity and network with professionals from industry, academia, and the public sector.
