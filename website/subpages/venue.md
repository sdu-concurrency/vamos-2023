## Location

VaMoS 2023 will take place at the Odense Campus of the [University of Southern
Denmark](http://www.sdu.dk/en/), [*Room

## Directions

You can use the [Rejseplanen (Journey
Planner)](https://www.rejseplanen.dk/webapp/?language=en_EN) service (available
in English) to find your way to SDU Odense. Alternatively, [Google
Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) is up to date and works just as well.

### Getting to Odense

Getting to Odense from either of the two main airports is easiest by train,
which stops at Odense's main station (Odense St.). You can buy tickets from
[DSB's website](https://www.dsb.dk/en/) (available in English).

#### From Copenhagen airport

The Copenhagen airport has a direct train line to Odense. Everything you need,
the ticketing office and the exit to the platforms, is available from the lobby
on Terminal 3 at the airport. The journey takes approximately one and a half
hour.

#### From Aarhus airport

There is unfortunately no direct line from the Aarhus airport to Odense.
Therefore, the trip is both by bus and train. The airport has a [direct bus
line](https://www.aar.dk/en/to-and-from-aar/) (available in English) to the
Aarhus main station, from which you can take the train to Odense. The journey
takes approximately two and a half hours.

#### From Billund airport

Like Aarhus, the trip from Billund airport is both by bus and train. The airport
has a [direct bus
line](https://www.bll.dk/en/parking-and-transport/to-and-from-the-airport/busser/)
(available in English) to the Vejle main station, from which you can take the
train to Odense. The journey takes approximately two hours.

### Getting to SDU

The University of Southern Denmark main campus can be reached by bus, by light
rail (Letbane) or by car.

Please note that the main campus is formed by an extended number of buildings.
If you get lost, just enter any university building: they are all connected, and
there are maps on most main doors. You can also find your way by using the
online map application available at <a target="_blank"
href="https://maps.sdu.dk">https://maps.sdu.dk</a>.
